        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p>The digital Simon game is an electronic memory skill challenge where players must repeat increasingly long, random sequences of lights and sounds. The core objective is to test short-term memory and focus, with the game ending if a player makes a mistake or runs out of time. </p>

        <h2>Gameplay Explained</h2>

        <p>The game unit typically has four large, colored buttons (Green, Red, Yellow, and Blue), each producing a distinct musical tone when pressed or activated by the device. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Watch and Listen: A round begins with the game unit lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, accompanied by corresponding sounds.</li>
            <li>Remember and Repeat: The player must then replicate the exact sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the correct order.</li>
            <li>Progressive Difficulty: If the player succeeds, the game unit adds another light and sound to the sequence, which the player must repeat along with the previous pattern.</li>
            <li>Game Over: The game continues to add complexity in each round, building suspense until the player makes a mistake, presses the wrong button, or takes too long to respond. A distinctive buzzer sound usually signals a loss. </li>
        </ol>
